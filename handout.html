<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>
  In this challenge, we will write a basic evolution simulation as shown <a target="_blank" href="/demos/evolution">here.</a>
  In this program you have a list of randomly generated genes, and each round, we go through and "combine" two genes to produce a third gene.
  This third gene is a combination of the previous two genes across two attributes: the color and the shape. We continue
  combining genes to create new generations until just one gene is left. A <strong>gene</strong> is a <strong>list</strong>
  of objects, where an object has a <strong>color</strong> and a <strong>shape.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  More specifically, a gene is an array of elements, with
  each element being a circle or square that is either red or blue (or later any color). In each round, we combine
  the two nearest elements to form a child that will make it into the next round.
</p>

</a>


<p>In the first part, we will start by writing a function to generate one "gene" which is a list of red and blue
  circles and squares. We will also draw that to the screen. You are required to write these functions.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
/* This function returns a list of red and blue circles and rectangles, with
 * NUM_ITEMS objects in the list. This gets one "gene."
 */
function generateList()

/* This function generates one random item from the list. The item is either
 * a circle or a square, and is either red or blue.
 */
function generateRandomItem()

/* This function draws a single gene, which is passed in as a parameter to 
 * the function.
 */
function drawList(list)
</pre>

<p>In the second part, we will use the functions we wrote in the first part to create a full "generation." A generation
  is a list of genes. We will also generalize our drawing function to draw all of the genes to the screen.
</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
/* This function creates a generation, which is NUM_LISTS genes. 
 */
function createGeneration()


/* This function draws all of the genes in the generation. It should make
 * use of the helper function draw list
 */
function drawAll()


/* This function draws a single gene, which is passed in as a parameter to 
 * the function.
 *
 * This function is modified from the earlier part to now take as an additional
 * parameter, a y coordinate, where this list should be draw.
 */
function drawList(list, y)
</pre>

<p>In this part we will combine adjacent pairs of genes until there is only one gene left.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
/* This function should combine two genes, a and b, to create a gene for the
 * next round. This should call the createElem helper function.
 */
function combineLists(a, b)

/*
 * This function takes two objects, and creates a new object for the next round.
 * There are two main properties for the object, which are the shape (circle
 * or square) and the color (red or blue). The shape is determined by randomly
 * picking one of the parents and taking its shape. The color is deteremined
 * in the same way.
 */
function createElem(a, b)
</pre>


<p>
  <ul>
    <li>You want to generate NUM_LISTS lists.</li>
    <li>You should run a generation each DELAY miliseconds</li>
    <li>You want lots of helper functions here! Try to keep every function under 20 lines.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>
  Helpful Hints
</h3>

<p>
  How to Merge Two Lists
</p>

<p>The rules for generating the next round are to get the two lists
that are closest to each other and haven't been processed this round. Now to combine them,
you iterate through both lists. To choose which element makes it to the next round, you randomly
pick the shape from one of the two parents, and then separately randomly pick the color from
one of the two parents. If we have elements which are both squares, the child is a square. But if
the elements are a circle and a rectangle, the child could be either.</p>

</a>


<p>
In this step, when you combine to genes, you instead of picking the color from one or the other, you should average the colors out. You can use a handy method

<pre class="prettyprint">Color.average</pre>

which lets you do this.

<pre class="prettyprint">
var color = Color.average(color1, color2);
</pre>

<h3>Evolution Simulation: Part 5</h3>

</a>


<p>
In this step, you should allow an arbitrary number of initial colors, and each color should be chosen with a probability defined by the dictionary <code>COLOR_PROBABILITIES</code>

Each entry lists a color, and its probability of appearing. The probabilities will add up to 1.


<pre class="prettyprint">
var COLOR_PROBABILITIES = [{
  color: Color.red,
  p: 0.1
},{
  color: Color.blue,
  p: 0.7
},{
  color: Color.green,
  p: 0.2
}];
</pre>

You can generate a color with a set probability by generating a random number between 0 and 1, and then using that number to help you get to a color.

For example, if the number is less than 0.1, you pick red.
Then if the number is between 0.1 and 0.8 (0.1 + 0.7) you pick blue.
You should write a function to figure this out for any number of entries.
